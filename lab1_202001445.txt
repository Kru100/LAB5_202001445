Q-2:


Scope : The software will recognize some specific sounds by the intensity of it, also it will estimate the measure of the distance of that object from the user on the basis of frequency of the sound. That will alert the user by vibrating the phone on a certain pattern so he can sense it.
        The limit of the system is that it will not be able to recognize the sound if the place is so noisy. 


Features : It will detect the sound and measure the distance, speed etc the object. 
* It will have the record of some frequency or voices which the user wants to add in, so it can recognize that.
* System will generate a unique pattern of vibrations so that the user can recognize it.


Non-functional requirements : 
* Reliable
* It has to be a real time and have to send the alert immediately
* System has to be responsive as soon as it gets the specified frequency.
